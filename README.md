# Tic Tac Toe Game â€“ JavaScript Project

This is a simple web-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It was created to practice working with DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, procedural practices, and refactoring to object-oriented programming principles.
